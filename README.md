# Data Modeling with Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and B-Spline

This project focuses on the nonlinear modeling of Wages, Credit scoring, and Motorcycle datasets using the Generalized Additive Model and Basis spline (B-spline). Using B-splines allows the incorporation of flexibility in the models. In line with this, varying numbers of knots, degrees of polynomials, and degrees of freedom are considered to identify the best model that fits the data sets. 

**Goal:** 

Investigate and fit nonlinear relationships using the Generalized Additive Model and Basis spline with different smoothing parameters, number of knots, degrees of polynomials, and degrees of freedom. 

**Data**

Three different datasets are considered: Wages, Credit Scoring, and Motorcycle data.

**Statistical Techniques**

We consider statistical techniques and models such as:
*  Generalized Additive Model for Univariate Data
*  Generalized Additive Model for Multivariate Data
*  B-spline with different numbers of knots, degrees of polynomials, degrees of freedom, and truncated power basis function.


**Project**

R and R Markdown were used for the coding and the creation of the project which can be found here: [Data Modeling with Splines and GAM](https://rpubs.com/Saidat/B-Splines-and-GAM)
