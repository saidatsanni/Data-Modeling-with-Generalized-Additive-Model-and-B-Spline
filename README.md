# Data Modeling with Generalized Additive Model and B-Spline

This project focuses on the nonlinear modeling of Wages, Credit scoring, and Motorcycle datasets using the Generalized Additive Model and Basis spline (B-spline). Using B-spline allows the incorporation of flexibility in the models. In line with this, varying numbers of knots, degrees of polynomials, and degrees of freedom are considered. 

**Data**

Three different datasets are considered: Wages, Credit Scoring, and Motorcycle data.

**Goal:** 

Investigate and fit nonlinear relationships using the Generalized Additive Model and Basis spline with different smoothing parameters, number of knots, degrees of polynomials, and degrees of freedom. 


**Statistical Techniques**

We consider statistical techniques and models such as:
* Generalized Additive Model for Univariate Data
*  Generalized Additive Model for Multivariate Data
*  B-spline with different numbers of knots, degrees of polynomials, degrees of freedom, and truncated power basis function.


**Project**

R and R Markdown were used for the coding and the creation of the project which can be found here: [Data Modeling with Splines and GAM](https://rpubs.com/Saidat/B-Splines-and-GAM)
